                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        There are some levels of insurance claims that result in the title of a car being changed to represent the insurance incident.
                        Let's say you get rear-ended in a parking lot and your car sustains significant damage. Even if you
                        have the car professionally repaired and the car is as good as new, the insurance company can still
                        have the title of your car changed from "Clean" to "Salvage". In other words, the title has been
                        branded.
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        This "brand" has nothing to do with the current condition of the vehicle. Regardless of how great the car runs and looks
                        after having the damage removed and returned to new, the title will be branded forever. That is why
                        smart car buyers can purchase great cars at significantly lower prices. Branded title cars sell for
                        lower prices even though they are exactly like their clean title counterparts. This gives wise car
                        buyers a tremendous cost savings.

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        This value proposition is why branded title cars have become so popular and are getting harder to find.
                        <br />
                        <br />That is why AutoSource specializes in branded title cars and trucks. AutoSource is the largest dealer
                        in the United States dedicated exclusively to finding the cleanest branded title cars in America
                        and offering them to savvy car buyers wanting a great car at a great price.

                        <hr> Each day in America, there are nearly 20,000 vehicle accidents. Those accidents create vehicle damage
                        ranging from minor bumps and scrapes to total loss. With so many thousands of cars receiving "branded
                        title" status every day, the AutoSource Certified Buyers are trained to seek out the vehicles with
                        less damage, the cream of the crop.
                        <br />
                        <br />Those hand-selected vehicles are then professionally repaired by Authorized AutoSource Rebuilders.
                        All, damaged parts are replaced with new parts and then the vehicle is road tested on an aggressive
                        Drive Cycle. Once the vehicle successfully completes the road test, our Certified Inspectors conduct
                        a comprehensive 151 Point Inspection to make certain the vehicle has been fully reconditioned and
                        is ready for a new owner.

                        <hr> A vehicle which receives a branded title due to "flood" is the most requested type of branded vehicle
                        we sell at AutoSource. It is also the hardest to find, but our Certified Buyers keep finding more!
                        A "flood" car simply means the vehicle has been in or near some water. It does NOT mean the car has
                        been under water- not at AutoSource. Be warned: There are less reputable organizations selling flood
                        cars which have in fact been submerged. Do NOT purchase any flood car which has been submerged.

                        <br />
                        <br /> Our highly trained Reconditioning Team goes through a comprehensive moisture extraction process
                        using state of the art equipment and process to return the vehicle to pre-flood condition. After
                        reconditioning is completed, our Inspection team does a final inspection, testing all electronics,
                        switches and fuses to make 100% certain everything in the vehicle is fully operational.

                        Standard. They classify each flood vehicle as either a level 1, level 2, level 3 or level 4. Here
                        is a description of those four levels:
                        <br />

                        <ul>
                            <li>Level 1: Water has been near the vehicle and in some cases water has risen to mid-tire level,
                                but has NOT entered the interior of the vehicle.</li>
                            <li>Level 2: Water has risen high enough to enter the bottoms of the doors, resulting in water engaging
                                on the floorboards of the vehicle.</li>
                            <li>Level 3: Water has entered the vehicle and reached the bottom of the passenger seats.</li>
                            <li>Level 4: Water has entered the passenger cabin and has risen to the dashboard or above.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>NOTE:</b> AutoSource Certified Buyers only seek out Level 1 and Level 2 flood vehicles. This is not
                        true for others who sell branded title vehicles.

                        <br /> Hail comes in all shapes and sizes and usually without warning. Most hail is small pellets of ice
                        while some hail has been known to be as large as baseballs! Throwing dozens of baseball-sized ice
                        chunks at a car can leave small dings on the top surfaces of a vehicle such as hood, roof and trunk
                        lid.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Ding removal is a very time-consuming process and most insurance companies would rather brand the
                        title than invest in the expensive process of ding removal. Our Certified Buyers actively follow
                        weather patterns, so they can be the first buyers on scene to purchase vehicles impacted by hail.
                        <br />
                        <br /> AutoSource has invested heavily in the technology and key personnel who specialize in hail damage
                        reversal. The results are stunning! Once the Hail Reversal Team completes their work, the vehicle
                        goes through a final inspection and is then made available to the smart car buyers who come into
                        our dealerships every day seeking these hard-to-find branded title vehicles.

                        <hr>Every day in the United States, over 2,000 cars and trucks are stolen from their owners. These vehicles
                        usually sustain some level of damage in the process and often end up as branded title vehicles.
                        <br />
                        <br />Our Certified AutoSource Buyers are alerted to these thefts and are quick to go inspect the recovered
                        vehicles. If the damage is minor, our team purchases the vehicle and immediately sends it to our
                        Theft Reconditioning Team to meticulously go through the vehicle from front to back, cleaning, repairing
                        damage and then conducting a test-drive. From there, our Certified Inspection Team conducts a comprehensive
                        151-point inspection before giving the vehicle the AutoSource Seal of Approval.

                        <hr> AutoSource is the largest retailer of branded title vehicles in the United States. With over 25,000
                        vehicles sold (and counting!) AutoSource has set the standard for high quality, high value branded
                        title cars and trucks. Our secret? Our extraordinary team of Certified Buyers!
                        <br />
                        <br /> These men and women are among the most respected branded title vehicle evaluators in the world.
                        To become an AutoSource Certified Buyer, one must have a deep knowledge and background in the automotive
                        industry and/or insurance industry as well as a working knowledge of the reconditioning and rebuilding
                        process.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Their full-time job consists of traveling the United States reviewing and inspecting entire inventories
                        of branded title cars and trucks, looking for the cream of the crop to then be shipped to AutoSource
                        for a comprehensive reconditioning and rebuilding process followed by our infamous 151 point inspection
                        of the entire vehicle.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Our Certified Buyers are very hard to please and on some days it is not uncommon for them to reject
                        90% of the vehicles they inspect. AutoSource is committed to selling you and your family a car you
                        can enjoy and rely on for many years to come.
